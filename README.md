# Portfolio Website
My portfolio website, built with a homebrewed static site generator.

## Building
If you have `brew` and `NodeJS`, getting it running on your machine might look something like:

```
brew install pandoc ffmpeg
npm install
npm run build
npm run serve
```

Note that the fonts are not included in this repo, so the version you see on localhost will be using a fallback font (Helvetica, probably).

## Directory structure
- **`src`:**  "Source" folder contains all the working files.
- **`dist`:** "Distribute"â€”where all files are outputted after compilation. This folder is generated by project build scripts and is not under version control.

## Commands
NPM `run` commands wrap scripts found in the `./scripts` directory.

These scripts might not work on Windows unless run on a Linux subsystem. This is due to the use of `&` for process parallelization.

```
           build  Run all build commands  
                  runs: ./scripts/build.sh all

           clean  Delete "./dist/" directory 
                  runs: ./scripts/build.sh --clean

           serve  Run server on localhost:8080 (usually)
                  runs: live-server ./dist,

             dev  Start up development environment 
                  runs: npm run watch & npm run serve

          watch   Watch and build files when there are changes
                  runs: (npm run pre-watch) ./scripts/build lean
                        ./scripts/watch.js ./src

          deploy  Deploy to production server
  deploy:testing  Deploy to testing server
```

`./scripts/build.sh` can be used for more granular control. See `./scripts/build.sh --help` for more info:

```
./scripts/build.sh

Project Build Script
  Tell the script to run a specific filetype pipeline,
  or give it a filepath and it will figure it out

usage: 
  ./scripts/build.sh [commands...|files...] [--opts]

commands:
        all  Run all commands
       lean  Only run css, html, js and roster commands 
             (exlude long-running and less frequently used commands)
        css  Concatenate all CSS files to single file in output directory
        img  Optimize image files
       html  Convert markdown and templates files into HTML
     roster  Build project "roster" -- an ordered list of project files
             See `./create-roster.js` for more information
      video  Process video file(s), convert them to MP4,
             ouput them to assets folder in output directory 
    favicon  Copy favicon files to output directory
      fonts  Copy font files to output directory
         js  Contcatenate all javascript files into a single file
    
options:
 --help, -h  Show this message
    --clean  Delete output dir before building 

examples:
  ./scripts/build.sh all --clean
  ./scripts/build.sh css 
  ./scripts/build.sh src/index.md src/work.md
  ./scripts/build.sh src/index.md css
  ./scripts/build.sh html css
```


## Implementation
### CSS
Inspiration for the stylesheet came from [Raster Simple Grid Stystem](https://rsms.me/raster/) and [Every-Layout.dev](https://every-layout.dev/).

I'm using an algorithmic approach and tried to make the styles as composable as possible.

TODO: record subgrid work-around?

#### Subgrid workaround

```css
.subgrid {
}
```
-->


### Javascript
Each file in the JS directory is concatenated into a single JS file in the distribution directory, so, each file should be self-contained. (I suppose it could return a global variable, but, the site is [fundamentally] a series of documents, so... the scripts are self-contained and have explicit purposes.)

For example:
```js
(function () {
  document.addEventListener('click', (e) => {
    // do something with button data-attributes
    if( e.target.tagName === 'BUTTON') { console.log(e.target.dataset); }
  });
}());
```

### Templates
Templates are written in [Pandoc's HTML template language](https://pandoc.org/MANUAL.html#templates). It's limited, but gets the job done.

### Content Files
Content files are written in Markdown with YAML front-matter

##### Front-Matter
Along with template filename, front-matter can include paths to an additional YAML metadata file and Pandoc Lua filter

```yaml
title: Page title
subtitle: Page subtitle
template: path/to/tempalte
masthead:
  home: true
metadata: path/to/metadata.yml
filter: path/to/filter.lua
```

#### Lua Filter
[Pandoc Lua filter](https://pandoc.org/lua-filters.html)

Filters can be found in `scripts/filters/` directory. 

##### `absolute-links.lua`
Convert image and anchor link into absolute paths.  This is done so that images can be viewed locally while editing Markdown, while not having to worry about reference issues once they're up on the internet.

This filter is run on all content files.

#### `get-next-project.lua`
Adds the next project `title`,`subtitle`, and `href` to the case-studies template
Uses `src/case-studies/project-list.yml` to get the current files position in relation to the others.

Must be specified as a `filter` in front-matter. 

<!--
### Collections
Running `./scripts/create-project-list.js` will iterate through all projects in `src/case-studies` and create a new site file and YAML data file to be used by Pand
