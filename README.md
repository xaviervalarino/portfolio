# Portfolio Website
My portfolio website, built with a homebrewed static site generator.

## Dependencies
Tools used for building the site:

| tools            | version | used for                                                                       |

## Directory structure
- **`src`:**  "Source" folder contains all the working files.
- **`dist`:** "Distribution"â€”where all the source files are outputted after compilation

## Commands
NPM scripts are used build the site. 

_Note_: these scripts might not work on Windows unless run on a Linux subsystem. This is due to the use of `&` for process parrallelization.

```

## Implementation
### CSS
Inspiration for the stylesheet came from [Raster Simple Grid Stystem](https://rsms.me/raster/) and [Every-Layout.dev](https://every-layout.dev/).

### Javascript
Each file in the JS directory is concatenated into a single JS file in the distribution directory, so, each file should be self-contained. (I suppose it could return a global variable, but, the site is [fundamentally] a series of documents, so... the scripts are self-contained and have explicit purposes.)

### Templates
Templates are written in [Pandoc's HTML template language](https://pandoc.org/MANUAL.html#templates). It's limited, but gets the job done.

### Markdown Filters
All asset links are converted into absolute links through a [Pandoc Lua filter](https://pandoc.org/lua-filters.html). This is done so that images can be viewed locally while editing Markdown, while not having to worry about reference issues once they're up on the internet.
