### I am a designer in Oakland, California. I have experience designing for Infosec, Networking, NLP, genomic sequencing. 

> So you have B2B and some B2C experience, how do you wanna say that while not stretching yourself thin?

#### Life is too short for crappy software.
I design software with the aim of making tools that simple to use and easy to understand.
We create systems that are complex in the hopes that they will simplify our lives. That is rarely the case.

> tie this together with along the lines of _something something something, where the rubber meets the road._ 

#### I enjoy learning how complex systems work.

I have spent the last decade diving into how  *Nix systems, and am fascinated by how a philosophy that was written almost half a century ago has created tools that I use every day. I suspect that longevity is  to due to their composability and simplicity. 

Understanding the technoology used in the browser, networking, and delivering websites through learning NodeJS.
Learning the basics of programming and trying to apply what I have learned into how I work: breaking problems into discreet tasks.
Knowing when to show the underlying system to a  user vs. simplifying the systems complexity so that it doesn't get in the way.

Design is something that should be approached methodicallyâ€”inspiration is great and all, but can rarely be relied upon.

### I want to make systems that affect large groups of people for the better

I have spent the last 6 years as a freelancer. This has afforded me the opportunity to work with a wide range of clients and try my hand at owning every facet of the project. It has been a humbling experience, and one that has taught me a lot about what makes successful projects and, in turn, successful products.

At the moment I see a dearth in software marketed to small business, especially bespoke software. My hope was that software that is at the moment used as a utility for other software companies will begin to make it's way into smaller businesses that exist in unrelated industries.
