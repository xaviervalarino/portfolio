# About Me {.r-cell .large .span:1-2 .align-r }
:::{.r-cell .span:3-5 .margin-left }
I live in Oakland, CA.

### I enjoy learning how complex systems work. { .padding-top:l}
In learning a system, you come to understand what guided it's designers. Hopefully, you also find ways to explain that logic to others. The hardest part of interface design is knowing when to show the underlying system vs. simplifying the systems complexity so that it doesn't get in the way.

### My Design Process {.r-cell .span:1-2 .align-r .padding-top:xl }
:::{.r-cell .span:3-5 .margin-left  .padding-top:xl }
I generally move through five phases on a design project. Although their implementation is never really the same, they are can be defined as:

1. **Researching** the problem, the client's domain, the user's needs, limitations.
2. **Analyzing** how how to solve for _x_.
3. **Designing** a prototype to solve the problem.
4. **Testing** the prototype to figure out where the model succeeded and where  it fails.
5. **Rinse and repeat**---tweak the design until it produces the desired outcome.

### I want to make systems that improve the human conditions 
The less time we have to spend in front of a screen, the better.

I try to take the concepts I learn from these explorations and apply them to my workâ€”like the composability and ostensible simplicity of software like  [`coreutils`](https://www.gnu.org/software/coreutils/) or [NodeJS streams](https://nodejs.org/api/stream.html).

## About the Site {.r-grid .r-cell .span:1-2 .align-r .padding-top:l }
:::{.r-cell .margin-top .padding-left:xl .span:3-5}
The display font is [Uxum Grotesque](https://uxum.mdn.market/) by [Bureau Nuits](https://www.bureaunuits.com/).

The body font is [Inter](https://rsms.me/inter/) by Rasmus Andersson.

I wrote the site in Markdown, HTML, CSS. There's also a little bit of Lua and Bash, too. I'm using Pandoc to convert the Markdown and Node to orchestrate building and testing it.
