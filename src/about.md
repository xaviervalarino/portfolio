### I enjoy learning how complex systems work.
In learning a system, you come to understand what guided it's designers. Hopefully, you also find ways to explain that logic to others. The hardest part of interface design is knowing when to show the underlying system vs. simplifying the systems complexity so that it doesn't get in the way.


#### My design process
I generally move through four phases on a design project. Although their implementation is never really the same, they are can be defined as:

1. **Researching** the problem; the client's domain, the user's needs, and limitations.
2. **Observing** how people currently solve for _x_
3. **Designing** a prototype to solve the problem
4. **Testing** the prototype to figure out where the model succeeded and where  it fails.

Then rinse and repeat, tweaking the design until it produces the desired outcome.

### I want to make systems that improve the human conditions
The less time we have to spend in front of a screen, the better.

### Freelance
I have spent the last 6 years as a freelancer. This has afforded me the opportunity to work with a wide range of clients and try my hand at owning every facet of a project. It has been a humbling experience, and one that has taught me a lot about what makes successful projects and, in turn, successful products.

I try to take the concepts I learn from these explorations and apply them to my workâ€”like the composability and ostensible simplicity of software like  [`coreutils`](https://www.gnu.org/software/coreutils/) or [NodeJS streams](https://nodejs.org/api/stream.html).
