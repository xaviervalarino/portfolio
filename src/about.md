## I enjoy learning how complex systems work. { .margin-bottom:size2 }
<div>
In learning a system, you come to understand what guided it's designers. Hopefully, you also find ways to explain that logic to others. The hardest part of interface design is knowing when to show the underlying system vs. simplifying the systems complexity so that it doesn't get in the way.

I got my start in print. Bless the engineer at Adobe who put Javascript and GREP into InDesign---once I realized the potential, it was turtles all the way down.

I've spent the last ten years diving into Unix-like systems and web technologies. I try to take the concepts I learn from these explorations, ideas like---affordance, modularity, scalability, composability, simplicity, accessibility---and apply them to my work.

**I want to design systems that improve the human condition.**<br/>
Because life is too short for crappy software.

## My Design Process { .margin-bottom:size2 }

I generally move through five phases on a design project. Although their implementation is never really the same, I'd describe them as:

1. **Research** the problem, the client's domain, the user's needs, the limitations.
2. **Analyze** how how to solve for _x_.
3. **Design** a prototype to solve the problem.
4. **Test** the prototype to figure out where the model succeeded and where  it fails.
5. **Rinse and repeat**---tweak the design until it produces the desired outcome.

**I've designed software for:**

* Information Security
* Networking
* Natural Language Processing
* Genomic Sequencing

I've spent a fair amount of time as a freelancer, and have broad set of expertise; alongside product design, I do contract illustration.
