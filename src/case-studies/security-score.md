## Process 
1. Met with stakeholders to understand the requirements and technical limitations
1. Studied existing mockups and design assets
1. Identified four main areas that the system should cover:
    * Application states
    * Application elements
    * Colors and images
    * Customization options

After outlining the first three areas, I met with the marketing and engineering teams to finalize the customization options before working with the  technical writer to draft the guidelines.

## Outcome

Defined parts of the application that could be customized, defining a framework for how third party vendors could rebrand the application for their market.

The guidelines defined a process for how third party vendors submit customization requests, making clear what could and could not be changed.  It also provided us with an internal methodology for for defining and documenting OPSWAT's digital products.
